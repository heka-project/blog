All in all, we managed to come up with an updated app (Sean), Server (Shun Yuan), Admin Dashboard (Jeremy) and Tools that benefits the civilians. During the Demo, SAP representatives expressed their thoughts on how this project could be used in other aspect and the potential of the idea. These includes the use of the last-mile technology in delivery packages and the tools that I created to be used in vending machines that enable quicker and more efficient topping-up of the products.
 
In retrospective, Iâ€™m glad that our team chose this challenge as I have personally grown a lot in terms of programming skills and life skills through learning from one another. On top of that, our team has also become closer through all the fun times and stressful times. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my teammate for keeping me motivated and teaching stuff that I would not have known before taking this challenge, our FSD and P@ lecturers for the advice and guidance throughout this whole semester and tolerating our nonsense during class, and SAP that gave us the opportunity to pitch in front of them and giving industrial advice
