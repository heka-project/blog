For the prototype, while Sean and Shun Yuan are busy building a small-scale P2P network to demonstrate how it can facilitate the civilian delivery progress, Jeremy and I are working on getting the data from SAP CLOUD and displaying it the distribution of the vaccines via heatmap. The main challenge of this is that getting data from SAP IOT is a pain in the ass as there are no clear documentation on how it is done, and we have to figure it ourselves. In the end, we decided to bypass the SAP CLOUD and retrieve data directly from the database that Shun Yuan had created. 

The hackathon was a cool experience as it was the first time I had participated in such event and to work under extreme stress during the 3 days was really a challenge to both the team and I and luckily, we managed to pull it through and win the hackathon.
