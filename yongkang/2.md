In order to tackle the issues that were posed to us, Sean came out with an idea that we could make use of the wireless mesh networking provided by iOS to tackle the issues. The key feature of this wireless mesh networking is that it can operate without the use of internet connection and that’s a plus point given that the internet may be down during the case of an epidemic. The other key features of the idea is that it is fully civilian driven as the vaccination would be pass down from one civilians to another, the application is also able to make use of the metadata collected from the civilians to analyze the progress of the vaccines distribution. After the main ideation was down, we started to breakdown the job scope based on our specialties.
