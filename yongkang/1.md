We were given 6 topics to choose from and we decided to choose the SAP challenge as we found it the most interesting and it was the one that we had the most idea on. Initially, our idea was to have a ‘loot box’ at a specific location and users would unlock them using the public key sent to them if there are in the “vacinity” (pun intended). From there, that’s how we got our name “TEAM SAP BATTLE ROYALE”. However, after much discussion, we decided that this idea would cause more chaos than the traditional method as those in need of vaccines would fight for the vaccines. Therefore, we decided to scrape the name but kept the team name. 

In order to start coming out with the idea to the problem that we are given, we decided to break the challenges into specific area of the problems we are supposed to solve. They are 
-	Tracking delivery points and civilians and distribution point
-	Interpreting messages sent through the medical personnel 
-	Locating medical personnel
-	Public needs to track progress of delivery when the vaccines are available
