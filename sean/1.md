**Heka** is a school project I've been working on for the past few months. It explores the use of wireless mesh networking to facilitate last-mile delivery of vaccine payload during an epidemic crisis.

This post is a brief summary of what went down over the duration of the entire project.

## Context

At the start of the semester, we were given a few challenge statements to work on. After coming up with a project, we did a three-day hackathon to build prototypes and pitch (This was a graded assessment, so our grades were pretty much riding this hackathon ü•¥).

#### FAQ: Why was my team's name "Battle Royale"?

Initially joking around about how there has recently been a battle royale gamemode for every game, my groupmates and I teamed up with the idea titled **"Vaccine battle royale"**.

> The joke was to, much like in battle royale video games, distribute vaccines airdrop-style to civilians.

Now, we may have taken that joke _a bit too far_ during the initial stages, but when a sudden stroke of inspiration hit‚Äî the idea just sort of crystalised.

## Challenges

We started by laying out the challenges we wanted to tackle in getting self-administered vaccines out to everyone.

- ‚úÖ **Tracking delivery points to civilians AND distribution points**
- ‚úÖ **Interpreting messages sent through from the public and medical personnel**
- ‚úÖ **Locating medical personnel**
- ‚úÖ **Public needs to track progress of delivery and know when the vaccines are available**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Diagnosis services**

Medical diagnosis is no joke and requires someone with extensive domain knowledge, trying to come up with a tech solution for useful medical diagnosis without any sort of domain knowledge in this small timeframe is honestly just a dead end
