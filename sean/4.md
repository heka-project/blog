So for our prototype, the idea was to build a small scale P2P network to demonstrate how it can facilitate the civilian delivery process.

_Our hackathon workstation_

I wrote a simple demo iOS app, building a library on top of iOS's Multipeer Connectivity Framework to support the transmission of unified data throughout a P2P network (Almost our entire team uses iPhone).

Peers on the network with internet connection update a simple Node-backed application that caches network state with Redis. The idea was to carry out validation of new peers on the network server side.

### Design

Quick designs to ensure that our prototype brings accross it's application to real life.
