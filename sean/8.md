# Putting it all together

![](architecture.png)
Our updated architecture diagram

In all, we've managed to come up with an updated app, server (backed by mining pool), and dashboard.

After our assignments cleared up, we spent our last few days working on integration and squashing any leftover issues.

## Key technologies

At this point, I think its worthwhile to mention a few key technologies/tooling/platforms (other than SAP IoT) that have made our solutions possible:

- Our server side and 'slave' was built on Node.js, admin dashboard on ASP.NET
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) PaaS has really simplified our rapid deployment process.
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) is a very useful in-memory datastore that really got us started during the hackathon on the server side.
- [iOS Multipeer Connectivity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/multipeerconnectivity) is at the heart of our iOS P2P Library's implementation.
- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) to generate engaging visualisations on the dashboard.
