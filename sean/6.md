# Securing Transactions

Because we still have to store vaccine transaction records in a central silo, this makes it insecure and difficult to scale across a wider region. We thought about this and what steps to take in order to solve this problem.

### Distributed ledgers

The idea behind a distributed ledger seems to be a useful solution to this issue as it would solve issues with scaling and security.

While the others worked on getting the admin dashboard, I conceptualized a modified architecture that makes use of a decentralized ledger to store and validate vaccine transactions. Our current server side instance could collect transactions and marshal blocks to nodes for validation.

To do this, I need to:

- Work with my teammate Shun Yuan to modify the REST spec of the server
- Reflect these changes in the app model
- Implement 'slave' socket connection and protocol
