# Setting up the slave

In order for us to keep a distributed ledger of medical records, I need to implement a 'slave' client that can be distributed for nodes to join the mining pool. This client will need to be socketed with the server to receive and send blocks to mine. Upon receiving each block, the client should start validating it, replying with a solved block and adding it to it's ledger.

Because the server is written in JavaScript, It would be best to write the slave in JS as well in order to be more consistent with the socketing library that we would make use of.

The miner client was written in javascript, and uses socket.io for socket connections to the server.

## Blocks

In this case, our transactions are not very complex, so we decied to not use any form of hash tree (Merkle) to store transactions in each block.

## Proof of work

Following traditional blockchain implementations, I used the proof of work algorithm to mine blocks. The PoW algorithm is how blocks are created on the blockchain.

Miner clients will compete to mine the current through hashing the identity of the current block with a nonce.

## Blockchain-as-a-service?

In order to facilite the validation of mined blocks, I had to collaborate with my teammate working on the server to poll for new blocks to mine.
