# Setting up the slave

In order for us to keep a distributed ledger of medical records, I need to implement a 'slave' client that can be distributed for nodes to join the mining pool. This client will need to be socketed with the server to receive and send blocks to mine. Upon receiving each block, the client should start validating it, replying with a solved block and adding it to the blockchain.

Because the server is written in JavaScript, It would be best to write the slave in JS as well in order to be more consistent with the socketing library that we would make use of.
