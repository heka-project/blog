## Significance of the supply chain

According to the WHO, much of the world’s burden of disease can be prevented or cured with known, affordable technologies.

The problem is getting drugs, vaccines, and information to those who need them on time, reliably, and at a reasonable cost.

### Fully civilian-driven

With the help of civilian volunteers to kick off the distribution chain, we envision this to be a 100% civilian driven means of payload distribution.

### Agile

Without the conventional overhead from last-mile distribution/delivery, people will be able to receive proper vaccination quicker.

### Offline

Heka aims to be as frictionless as possible, as such, the distribution process is completely offline and done on the distributed network.

### Trackable

Making use of metadata sent from whenever there is an available internet connection on the users’ devices, we are able to analyse package spread patterns to follow the progress of package distribution.

## Why?

### More accessible

A civilian-driven means of distribution is much more affordable as it eliminates the conventional hassle and costs with conventional last-mile delivery methods.

### Medical Assistance

Without the need of a medical personnel to distribute the vaccine, more professional attention can be directed to civilians in need of assistance. Users with disabilities or elderly can request medical assistance to help administer the vaccine.

## Wiki

### Zones and Communities

The area of context is split up into zones. Medical personnel are each assigned to their respective zones so that they can respond quickly. Communities are created by clustering user addresses.

### Joining the chain

Civilians can download the app and register their family members to their account (up to 4 other people).

### Volunteer program

Civilians can step forward to become volunteers for their communities. The number of volunteers needed for each community is directly proportional to the number of people in the community.

### The distribution process

On the day of distribution, civilian volunteers kick off the distribution chain by collecting the designated package for their communities from medical personnel.
