# Final thoughts

Looking back now, I'm glad that we decided to work on such an exciting project. I feel that our team has really bonded and grown through the duration of the project, we learned from each other and had fun as well.

I think that the highlight for P2 was really the hackathon as we worked very hard on building our demo application, and preparing for our pitch.

## Takeaways

Here are some of my key takeaways.

- Great ideas can be birthed from jokes (Our team name is still 'Team Battle Royale' for some reason).
- Understanding the challenge statement in a business context is important to identify key objectives
- Be more open to project idea changes, they happen for the better sometimes.

## Appreciation

Thanks to my teammates for staying motivated to work on and participate in the project throughout the entire duration, our FSD and P2 Lecturers for advice and guidance, and the SAP reps that involved in our visit !
