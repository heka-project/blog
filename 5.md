One of the questions that was asked by the judges was “Other than heatmap, how can organizations like SAP or the public make use of data?” With this question kept in mind, I decided that there definitely more useful ways to show the data collected. Therefore, I decided to come out with two more tools that would benefit the civilians. First, I created a map that shows all the locations of the packages and users can click the location they are in and it would show the nearest package that are available to them. This is particularly useful when civilians are anxious about getting the package and with this function, they would have a gauge of how long more it would need for the package to arrive to them. Secondly, as the civilians need to pass the package to the other civilian and return back home ager delivering it, I created a tool that help them to calculate the most effective way of delivery the package using Turf.js
